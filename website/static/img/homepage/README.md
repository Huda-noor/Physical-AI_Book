## Image Guidelines

### Format
- Use JPEG or WebP formats for photographs
- Use PNG for graphics with transparency
- Use SVG for simple vector graphics

### Size

- Ensure images are high resolution but optimized for web

## How to Add Images

1. Place your images in this directory (`static/img/homepage/`)
2. Make sure filenames match the ones referenced in the code:
   - `humanoid-robot-hero.jpg`
   - `embodied-intelligence.jpg`
   - etc.
3. Run `npm run build` to ensure the site builds correctly with your images
4. Test the site locally with `npm run start`
